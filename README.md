## Task description
Imagine we are organizing a dinner. 30 people have confirmed that they will come. We will all be seating at five 6-person tables (A, B, C, D, E, respectively). There will be 3 courses. After each course we'll change our seats. We'd like every person to sit with as many different people as possible throughout the dinner. As a bonus you may think of future similar occasions where different number of people and tables may be available.
